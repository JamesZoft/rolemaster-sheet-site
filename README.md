This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a data-driven purely front end app to try and mimic a spreadsheet I'm currently using for a game system called Rolemaster. It's backed directly by Firebase which handles data storage, deployment and authorisation.

It's intentionally designed to look spreadsheet-y - I and others have been using a spreadsheet to run this game for years, so it's imperative that the look and feel be similar so that everyone will want to switch over and have an easy time of it.



Core tech used:

[React](https://reactjs.org)
